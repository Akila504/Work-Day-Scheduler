//First part in HTML I can hard code the time block html
//i.e from 9 am to 5pm 



//Second part once the HTML is done// 

// we will have to select all the time blocks that we need i.e using one ID tag 
// omce the time blocks are selected we need to be able to add in a description to each time slot 



//if one of the time blocks is clicked then we want to be able to input text
//if the current time block time is either greater or less than the current time we need to color code
//each time block should have a save button appended to it
// the save button should have a click event when clicked will save the user input into local storage.
// the events should be present even on page refresh
