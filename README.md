# Work-Day-Scheduler 

## Description
The main objective of this project was to create a color coded work day sheduler, based on the current time and day.

The reason for doing this project was to utilise jquery as well as to reinforce other concepts of javascript fundamentals such as local storage

From this project I reinforced my knowledge on localstorage. Additionally, I have gained a lot of experience in using jquery in place of vanilla javascript for the same
functionality.
